# Maven Sigstore Test

A simple Maven Project for demonstrating the `sigstore-maven-plugin` for signing artifacts deployed to remote Maven repositories.

This will also, eventually, serve as an example of a fully automated Maven deployment to Maven Central using GitHub Actions.

You can see the content being produced by this project, along with the Sigstore content, here in Maven Central:
